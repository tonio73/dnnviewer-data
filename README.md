## Model descriptions

### MNIST digits

Two models are provided for the MNIST digits classification:
- A convolutional network similar to the LeNet5 but with ReLU, Dropout and smaller size
- A full-connected/dense network

Both were designed in this notebook [_Convolutional versus Dense layers in neural networks - Part 1_](https://github.com/tonio73/data-science/blob/master/cnn/CnnVsDense-Part1.ipynb) and this Medium Post [_Dense or Convolutional â€” Part-1_](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/dense-or-convolutional-part-1-c75c59c5b4ad)

### CIFAR-10

Two convolutional networks:
- First one is based on the Keras CNN Tutorial with some regularization, it has 3 convolutional and 2 dense layers. More details in this notebook [_Model to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset_](https://github.com/tonio73/data-science/blob/master/cnn/CnnCifar10.ipynb)

- Second is provided by SJD1882 it has 6 convolutional and 3 dense layer and a performance gain of 10%.

### Fashion MNIST

Three evolutions of a Fashion MNIST CNN classifier based on the LeNet5 architecture as reported in this notebook [_MNIST Fashion classification with convolutional neural network_](https://github.com/tonio73/data-science/blob/master/cnn/CnnMnistFashion-Keras.ipynb). Each model is saved over the training epochs as Keras checkpoints.
- Model 1 : is the raw model without regularizer, accuracy is 90% with overfitting
- Model 2 : is adding dropout, accuracy is 91%
- Model 3 : is adding padding, accuracy is 92%
